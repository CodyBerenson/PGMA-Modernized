Plex metadata agent for fetching metadata from GayEmpire material and IAFD

20190816 - Plugin adapted off Briadin's excellent AdultDVDEmpire Plex metadata agent.
            Actor thumbnails are solely sourced from IAFD.com
            made some significant changes - background art is off the back cover of the dvd
            removed code downloading galleries and scene pictures
            removed search code looking for similar movies in list looking for a match
            all matching is based on the exact filename of the movie. 
            The filename must conform to this format (Studio) - Title (Year).ext
