# Installation and Usage
Note:  Changes are frequently made to Preferences.  When you download and install a new release to the Agents, you will need to set preferences if the release made a change to the preferences. It is the best practice to:
1.  Stop your PMS
2.  Download the latest agents
3.  Delete the existing agents in your PMS Plugins
4.  Copy the latest agents to your PMS Plugins
5.  Restart your PMS
6.  Check the preferences for each agent; set new preferences if any
7.  Stop and restart your PMS
